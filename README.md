# DATASET_PREPROCESSING
preliminary script sharing folder for preprocessing Dataset

right now, focus mainly on face dataset: 1.CK+ 2.JAFFE 3. Fer2013

Currently, Mainly use for the FER2013 dataset
Due to objective of research is to mimic human capacity in generalizing emotion recognition ability, to implemet small dataset in emo-recognition will be realisic symmetry.

Both CK+ and JAFFE datasets were suffered from posed expression(with direct instructions) and segemtated expression

For future research aims, I am willing to use unsupervised learning to learn emotion recogntion.
